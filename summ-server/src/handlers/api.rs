//! `/api/v1/` - the discovery API the web UI is built on.
//!
//! None of this is in the Distribution Spec. `GET /v2/_catalog` was removed
//! before v1.0.0 and nothing standard answers "what is in this registry", which
//! is exactly the operation summ exists to make fast. So the shapes here are
//! ours to choose, and the cost is that nothing external validates them - hence
//! `tests/discovery.rs`.
//!
//! Three choices worth stating, because they are the ones a spec would
//! otherwise have made:
//!
//! The route table is flat - `repositories`, `tags`, `manifests`, each taking
//! the repository name as everything after it - because a repository name may
//! contain `/`, and a nested `/repositories/<name>/tags` would mean two things
//! in a registry holding both `foo` and `foo/tags`. [`crate::app::api_route`]
//! has the detail.
//!
//! - **The cursor is in the body, not a `Link` header.** `/v2/` uses `Link`
//!   because a decade of clients parse it. This API has exactly one client
//!   family - `fetch` - and a JSON caller that has already parsed the body
//!   should not have to parse a header to find out whether to ask again.
//! - **A count may be a floor.** The scale target is 10M manifests in one
//!   repository, so counting to completion on a request thread is not an
//!   option, and there is no stored total because maintaining one would be the
//!   read-modify-write on the push path that the key schema exists to avoid.
//!   Every count therefore carries `complete`, and a UI renders a `false` as
//!   `10,000+`.
//! - **Pages here are small by default.** A row on the repository list costs a
//!   bounded count per repository, so the default page is [`DEFAULT_PAGE`] and
//!   the ceiling [`MAX_PAGE`] - both far below the `/v2/` limits, which page
//!   over a single key range and cost one seek.
//!
//! Versioned as `/api/v1/` separately from `/v2/`: the two move for entirely
//! different reasons, and pinning this to the spec's version number would be a
//! promise nobody asked for.
