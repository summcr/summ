//! The router and the `/v2/` path dispatcher.
//!
//! # Why the routing is hand-written
//!
//! A repository name may contain `/`: `foo/bar/baz` is one name, not three path
//! segments. So `/v2/{name}/blobs/{digest}` is not expressible in axum's
//! router at all, and the operation is identified by a *suffix* of the path
//! rather than a prefix.
//!
//! The two known answers are to generate one route per name depth - Trow
//! generates seven with a macro pair, which caps names at seven components -
//! or to take a single catch-all and split the suffix by hand. summ takes the
//! second: it has no depth limit, it puts the whole route table in one
//! readable function, and [`route`] is then a pure `&str -> Endpoint` function
//! that can be unit-tested without a server.
//!
//! Note also that axum 0.8 changed path syntax from `/:param` to `/{param}`;
//! the old form is not deprecated, it panics at startup.
