//! API-key authentication.
//!
//! One axis, three points: `--auth-mode` says how open the registry is.
//! `open`, the default, requires no credential at all - `summ serve` with no
//! arguments is an anonymous read-write registry, which is what makes it
//! usable in one command. `public-pull` serves every read to anyone and
//! requires the write key for everything that changes the registry, which is
//! the shape of a public registry: anonymous pull, authenticated push.
//! `private` requires a key for everything, with a read key that reads and a
//! write key that does both.
//!
//! The names describe the registry rather than the mechanism, and the middle
//! one names an operation where the other two name a posture - deliberately.
//! `open` and `private` say all there is to say on their own; a bare `public`
//! would not, because a public repository on a hosted registry is one anyone
//! may *pull* while summ's default is one anyone may also push. The word is
//! contested exactly here, so the name settles it.
//!
//! # Why `Basic`, when the spec's example is `Bearer`
//!
//! The spec's authentication flow (§Authentication) is a `401` carrying
//! `WWW-Authenticate`, and it is deliberately open about the scheme. `Bearer`
//! is what the hosted registries advertise, but it means something specific to
//! a client: the challenge names a `realm` that is a *token server*, and docker
//! and containerd will go and `GET` it, exchange credentials for a scoped
//! bearer token, and only then retry. Advertising `Bearer` without standing up
//! that endpoint produces a client that fails in the token exchange rather than
//! one that authenticates.
//!
//! `Basic` is the challenge those same clients answer by sending the
//! credentials they already hold, which is exactly the model here: the key *is*
//! the credential, and there is nothing to exchange it for. So `docker login`,
//! `oras login` and `podman login` work with the key as the password, a browser
//! opening the UI gets its native prompt, and no token endpoint has to exist.
//!
//! `Bearer <key>` is *accepted* anyway, because it is what a human with `curl`
//! reaches for and costs one match arm. It is never advertised.
//!
//! # What is protected
//!
//! Under `private`, everything: `/v2/`, `/api/v1/` and the UI, through one
//! middleware in [`crate::app::router`]. There is no exemption list,
//! deliberately - an exemption is a hole that has to be re-argued every time a
//! route is added, and the two candidates both fail on inspection. `GET /v2/`
//! is the endpoint whose `401` is how a client *discovers* it needs
//! credentials, so exempting it would break the flow it exists for. And the
//! UI's assets are worth no less than the API they read: serving the shell to
//! an anonymous browser only moves the prompt to the first `fetch`, where a
//! native dialog on an XHR is a worse experience than one on the document.
//!
//! Under `public-pull` the line is drawn by [`Access::of`] and by nothing
//! else: a
//! rule about what a request *does*, applied to every route alike, rather
//! than the list of routes an exemption would have been. The consequence is worth
//! stating plainly, because it is the mode and not a hole in it - `_catalog`,
//! every tag list, every manifest and the whole UI are readable by anyone who
//! can reach the port.
//!
//! A credential that *is* presented is checked in every mode, including on a
//! read that required none. The alternative - ignoring a credential wherever
//! it was not needed - is a registry that answers `200` to
//! `Authorization: Bearer wrong`, which makes a mistyped key indistinguishable
//! from a right one until the first push and gives a client no way to find out
//! it is misconfigured.
//!
//! Note what this does *not* buy, because it is tempting to assume it: under
//! `public-pull` it does not make `docker login` or `oras login` validate a
//! key.
//! Those clients ping `GET /v2/` without a credential and only send one when
//! the answer is a `401`; here the answer is `200`, so nothing is sent and
//! nothing can be rejected. `login` succeeds on any key, and the push is the
//! first thing that checks it. Under `private` the ping *is* a `401`, the client
//! retries with the credential, and a wrong key fails at login as expected.
