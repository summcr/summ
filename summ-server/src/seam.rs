//! The seam between the HTTP layer and everything below it.
//!
//! `summ-registry` (manifest and tag operations over `WriteBatch`) and
//! `summ-storage` (the content-addressed blob store) are separate crates built
//! separately. This trait is what the handlers actually call, so the HTTP layer
//! is complete and testable before either exists, and so wiring them up later
//! is an implementation of one trait rather than a rewrite of the handlers.
//!
//! Three rules shaped it, and they are worth keeping if it grows:
//!
//! - **Every method is a single registry operation**, not a step in one. There
//!   is no `begin`/`commit` pair, because a push must land as one `WriteBatch`
//!   and a seam that let the HTTP layer sequence writes would make that
//!   impossible to guarantee.
//! - **Failures are expressed in spec terms** ([`OpsError`]), not storage
//!   terms. The layer below knows that an offset did not match; only the layer
//!   above knows that means `416 BLOB_UPLOAD_INVALID`.
//! - **Identifiers are minted above and passed down.** `create_upload` takes
//!   the id rather than returning one, because a `WriteBatch` must contain no
//!   engine-minted values if it is to mean the same thing when replayed on a
//!   replica.
//!
//! Pagination is a page plus a `more` flag rather than an opaque cursor. The
//! flag is the whole reason `Link` can be emitted only when a further page
//! genuinely exists - the reference implementation cannot tell, so it emits
//! `Link` on the final page too and every client pays for one wasted request.
