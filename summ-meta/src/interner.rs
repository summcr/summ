//! Repo name <-> id interning.
//!
//! Names are interned to a `u32` so a long repo name is not repeated in every
//! key. Both directions are persisted (`n` name->id, `i` id->name) and the
//! in-memory side is a bounded LRU, not a full map.
//!
//! The bound is the point. Ten million repos at a typical name length would be
//! well over a gigabyte resident across both directions, plus a full scan at
//! startup before the registry could serve anything. A cache of the hot set
//! instead makes startup O(1), and a miss costs one B-tree lookup that is
//! usually already in the page cache.
