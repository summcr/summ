//! The schema version marker and the migration seam.
//!
//! A lost or unreadable metadata store is a dead registry: manifest bytes live
//! only under `Z` and tags only under `T`, so there is nothing to rebuild from.
//! The cheapest insurance against the *silent* half of that failure is a version
//! marker, and it exists now rather than when it is first needed because
//! retrofitting one onto a populated store means guessing what that store
//! already contains.
//!
//! What makes it load-bearing is postcard. It is not self-describing: a record
//! written before a field was added does not decode afterwards, and the error it
//! produces is indistinguishable from corruption. Refusing to open a store this
//! build does not understand turns that into a sentence an operator can act on.
//!
//! This is engine-agnostic on purpose - it is written against [`MetaEngine`], so
//! both engines get it and neither can drift.
