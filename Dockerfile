# summ — an OCI Distribution Spec registry in one binary.
#
# Multi-stage: a builder on the official Rust image, a runtime on
# debian-slim holding nothing but the binary and the shared libraries
# RocksDB's C++ needs. The dependency build is cached as its own layer with
# cargo-chef, which matters more here than in most Rust projects:
# librocksdb-sys compiles RocksDB 11.8 from source, so a cold build is
# minutes of C++ and an uncached one repeats it on every source edit.

# with anything and there is nothing for a knob to solve. Fixing it keeps
# EXPOSE, the healthcheck and every compose file or `containerPort` in
# agreement about a single number.
