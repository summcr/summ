//! Binary key encoding.
//!
//! Every key begins with a single-byte prefix; uppercase prefixes hold registry
//! data, lowercase hold internal bookkeeping - the repo-name interner and the
//! schema version. Repo names are interned to a
//! `u32` so a long name is not repeated in every key, and digests are stored raw
//! rather than as hex, halving their size.
//!
//! redb orders `&[u8]` keys lexicographically, so a prefix scan yields entries
//! already sorted the way the Distribution Spec's pagination requires.
//!
//! Fan-in relationships (which manifests reference a blob, which tags point at a
//! manifest) are stored as one key per edge rather than as a vector inside a
//! single value. At registry scale a popular base layer is referenced by
//! millions of manifests; an inline vector would mean rewriting a multi-megabyte
//! value on every push that touched that layer. One key per edge makes adding a
//! reference an O(1) insert, makes "is this still referenced?" a single seek,
//! and removes read-modify-write from the write path entirely.
