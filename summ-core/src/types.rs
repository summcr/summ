//! Values stored against the keys in [`crate::keys`].
//!
//! Records hold only bounded, fan-out data. A manifest lists its own layers and
//! children because both are small and fixed at push time. Anything with
//! unbounded fan-in - which manifests reference a blob, which tags point at a
//! manifest - lives in its own key range instead, so no value grows with the
//! size of the registry.
//!
//! Several records denormalise a descriptor that could in principle be looked
//! up elsewhere. That is deliberate and bounded: `ReferrerRecord` copies the
//! referrer's own descriptor because the referrers response is an image index
//! that cannot be built without it, and `TagEvent` copies one because tag
//! history must stay queryable after the manifest it names has been deleted.
//! Both are one descriptor per edge, not a set that grows.
//!
//! postcard is not self-describing, so a record written before a field was
//! added will not decode afterwards. Adding a field is therefore a migration,
//! gated on [`crate::keys::db_version`].
