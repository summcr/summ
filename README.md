**summ** is a simple yet powerful container registry with batteries included. It
fully supports the OCI Distribution Spec and adds the practical things a
registry should have had all along — image pull statistics, tag history, a
built-in web UI — so it is useful the moment it starts.

summ is written in Rust, with a bespoke data structure for extremely efficient
storage and retrieval of registry metadata, which is what makes it fast where
it counts: on the four serial metadata lookups a real `docker pull` waits on.

## Features

**Pull counts, per day and per hour.** Every repository, tag and manifest gets a
thirty-day contribution grid and a last-24-hours strip, so "what is anyone
actually pulling" is a page rather than a log-parsing exercise. Serving a pull
never touches the store — a `GET` adds to a map in memory and a background task
folds it into the metadata store every few seconds — so the counters cost the
pull path nothing.

**Tag history.** Every tag mutation has been recorded since the first push, so
you can ask what a tag has pointed at over time *and* what a manifest has ever
been called. Both are the same endpoint, addressed by tag or by digest, newest
first, cursor-paged. History outlives what it describes: a deleted tag still
answers, because "gone" is exactly the question you are asking.

**A built-in web UI.** Same binary, same port, assets compiled in — no build
step, no framework, no CDN, so it works air-gapped. Browse repositories with
per-repo tag and manifest counts, search names by substring, drill into a manifest,
and see the pull-count grids and tag timelines beside the thing they describe.

**Metadata lookups are the product.** Four of the five serial steps in a cold
`containerd` pull are metadata lookups, and their latencies add — so summ is
built around a purpose-designed key schema over RocksDB rather than around the
byte path. Nothing is a directory walk, no stored value grows with the size of
the registry, and prefix bloom filters make the hot existence checks ~6× faster
than the defaults. Measured: 7.42 GiB layers pushed at ~1.0 GB/s and pulled back
from four concurrent clients at ~1.1 GB/s aggregate.

**Discovery as a first-class API.** `/api/v1/` serves repositories, tags,
manifests, tag history and pull counts as a flat, cursor-paged, read-only
surface. Every list takes a cursor and a limit; the design target is 10M
repositories and up to 10M manifests in a single one, so nothing here
materialises an unbounded set. Both surfaces are documented in
[docs/api.md](docs/api.md).

**One binary, no dependencies.** RocksDB is compiled in and statically linked.
No database to run, no object store, no sidecar — `./summ serve` is the whole
deployment. Optional API-key auth (`--auth-mode open|public-pull|private`) puts
a read key and a write key in front of the registry, the discovery API and the
UI at once.

**Conformant.** The OCI `distribution-spec` conformance suite passes with zero
failures at every profile, including the OCI 1.1 referrers API — 1032 checks
passing at the suite's `dev` profile, with nothing skipped.

## Download

Prebuilt binaries for four targets are published on the
[releases page](https://github.com/summcr/summ/releases). Asset names carry no
version, and `releases/latest/download/` resolves to the newest release, so an
install line never needs updating.

| Platform | Asset |
|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 | `summ-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |
| Linux arm64 | `summ-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |
| macOS Apple silicon | `summ-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | `summ-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` |

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/summcr/summ/releases/latest/download/summ-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz \
  | tar -xz summ
./summ serve
```

On Linux, RocksDB and its C++ runtime are linked in statically, so the only
shared libraries left are the ones every glibc system already has — `libc`,
`libm` and `libgcc_s`. The build floor is glibc 2.34: Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12,
RHEL 9 and newer. The macOS builds link nothing beyond the OS's own libraries
and run on macOS 11 and up.

Every asset has a `.sha256` beside it. `dev` is a rolling prerelease built from
`main` on demand — swap `latest/download` for `download/dev` to fetch it. Being
a prerelease, it never becomes `latest`.

## Deployment

`./summ serve` is already a complete registry, so there is nothing to stand up
alongside it. For running it as a long-lived service — a dedicated user, a
sandboxed systemd unit, and TLS terminated in front of it — see
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).
