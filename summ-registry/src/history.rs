//! Tag history - the read side of the `H` and `J` ranges.
//!
//! Nothing here writes. The events have been written on every tag mutation
//! since Phase 1, in the same [`WriteBatch`](summ_meta::WriteBatch) as the
//! mutation itself, by [`Registry::stage_set_tag`] and
//! [`Registry::stage_delete_tag`]; this module is what finally reads them back.
//!
//! Four properties of the storage that a caller has to know about, because they
//! decide what the answers mean:
//!
//! - **Newest first, and free.** The timestamp is stored complemented, so a
//!   forward scan - the only kind [`MetaEngine`](summ_meta::MetaEngine) has -
//!   arrives in descending order with nothing to sort.
//! - **The cursor is real values, not a token.** `before` alone is a filter -
//!   strictly-before that instant - and a caller can ask for a window with it
//!   directly. Paging adds `last`, the tiebreaker off the final row, because
//!   two events can share a millisecond and a page can end inside one; see
//!   [`HistoryCursor`].
//! - **It is an event log, not a list of what the tag pointed to.** A repoint
//!   writes one `Created` for the new digest and no `Deleted` for the displaced
//!   one, so "what did this tag point to at time T" is the newest `Created` at
//!   or before T, unless a `Deleted` is newer. And because the event is written
//!   unconditionally, pushing the same tag at the same digest twice is two
//!   events - it records pushes, not changes.
//! - **It outlives the manifest.** `media_type` and `size` are denormalised into
//!   the event precisely so a row still renders after `M <repo> <digest>` is
//!   gone, which is the state every `Deleted` event describes.
//!
//! Neither range is bounded by current state - they are the only ranges that
//! grow with time rather than with content - and nothing trims them yet. A
//! retention window is a `DeletePrefix` over a bounded suffix of each range and
//! belongs to the purge sweep.
