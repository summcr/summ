//! In-progress blob uploads - the `U <uuid>` key range.
//!
//! An upload session is metadata, not storage. The staged bytes belong to the
//! blob store; what lives here is the pair that makes the upload resumable -
//! the committed `offset` and the hasher state at exactly that offset - plus
//! the repo the session belongs to and the algorithm it was opened under.
//!
//! Keeping the session here rather than beside the staging file is deliberate,
//! and it is the one place summ improves on distribution's arrangement rather
//! than merely differing from it. distribution writes `_uploads/<id>/startedat`
//! and a `hashstates/<algo>/<offset>` file per resume point, so an interrupted
//! upload can only continue on the node that holds those files. Here the resume
//! point is 104 bytes inside a record that is already transactional with
//! everything else, so a chunked upload can continue on any process - which is
//! what stops chunked uploads from becoming an HA constraint.
//!
//! Two invariants the callers depend on:
//!
//! - **`offset` and `hasher_state` are written in the same batch, always.**
//!   Either alone is useless, and a pair from different moments resumes onto a
//!   hole. [`Registry::plan_save_upload`] takes the whole record for that
//!   reason rather than offering field-wise updates.
//! - **The session record is committed after the bytes it describes are
//!   written.** Same ordering rule as a blob: staged bytes ahead of the
//!   recorded offset are garbage the resume truncates away, whereas a recorded
//!   offset ahead of the bytes is corruption.
